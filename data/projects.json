    "shortDescription": "Professional B2B business platform with responsive design and high-performance optimization.",
    "intro": "During my internship at Vishal Global Tech, I developed Indelhincr.com, a professional business platform designed to establish a digital footprint for the client. I took the project from a design concept to a fully functional live site, focusing on creating a professional B2B interface that effectively showcases their service portfolio.",
    "problem": "The client lacked a centralized digital presence, making it difficult to build brand authority or capture online inquiries. The existing process for client onboarding was entirely manual, and there was no mobile-responsive destination for potential partners to view their service offerings or company credentials.",
    "solution": "I engineered a responsive, high-performance website with a focus on user conversion and intuitive navigation. By implementing a clean UI and integrated lead-capture forms, I streamlined the communication bridge between the client and their customers, ensuring a seamless experience across all device types.",

    "shortDescription": "Specialized web application for real-time personal finance management and expense tracking.",
    "intro": "Developed during my internship at My Job Grow, this project is a specialized web application designed to help users monitor their personal finances in real-time. I built a functional, interactive dashboard that allows for seamless expense logging and category-based tracking to improve financial literacy for users.",
    "problem": "Many users struggle with overspending due to a lack of immediate visibility into their daily transactions and budget limits. Existing manual methods, like spreadsheets or paper logs, are often cumbersome, inaccessible on the go, and fail to provide instant visual feedback on spending habits.",
    "solution": "I designed a streamlined, mobile-first application that simplifies financial management through an intuitive 'Add-and-Track' interface. The solution features automated balance calculations, a historical transaction log, and a clean UI that removes the friction from daily expense reporting.",

    "shortDescription": "AI-driven intelligent platform bridging theoretical coding knowledge with practical application.",
    "intro": "As the Project Lead, I spearheaded the development of Code Mentor AI, an intelligent platform designed to bridge the gap between theoretical coding knowledge and practical application. I managed a cross-functional team to build an AI-driven assistant that provides real-time guidance, code reviews, and learning paths for aspiring developers.",
    "problem": "Self-taught developers often struggle with 'tutorial hell,' where they can follow instructions but fail to debug or understand logic in their own unique projects. Existing AI tools are often too generic, whereas human mentorship is expensive and not scalable, leaving a need for a specialized, accessible AI mentor tailored for coding.",
    "solution": "I led the architectural design and implementation of a centralized AI hub that offers interactive code analysis and personalized feedback loops. By coordinating the frontend and backend development cycles, I ensured the platform delivered instant, context-aware solutions, helping users resolve complex logic issues while learning the underlying principles.",
